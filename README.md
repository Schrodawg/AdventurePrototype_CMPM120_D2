A simple adventure game by {Craig Schroeder} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: ("scene1", "scene2", "scene3", "scene4").
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: ("Intro", "Outro").
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: (The Crash, Inland, Further Inland, Shrine).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: (grave + final artifiact)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: (scene transition text + grave)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: (scene transition text + grave being deleted when clicked)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: (airplane in "Intro" + player character + artifact)

Asset sources:
- Backgrounds were made in MS Paint. Objects like the plane, player, and grave in Adobe Photoshop. 

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
